- HR can specify different job description/requirements for different portals
    - e.g. linkedin has better applicants, so be more specific
    - e.g. jobstreet has more applicants but less quality applicants, so do something else

- manual syncing or auto syncing

- when viewing the job in internal dashboard, what details needed with regards to external portals
    - when was it last synced
    - how many applicants
    - how many good applicants
    - chart of when we received submissions​

- not all jobs are posted to all portals
    - certain jobs only posted to a subset of portals

- sometimes job is only open internally (for a fixed time), then published externally

- admin can set daily/weekly sync schedule

- syncing only happens 5 minutes after update, give admin the chance to cancel the syncing if there are mitstakes

​- maintenance monitoring
    - sysadmin needs to know how many syncs happened per day
    - if any failed syncing, how many retries do we do?
    - if we got blacklisted, a lot of failed syncing attempts, get notified
